{"name":"Jbpm-spring-demo","tagline":"jBPM 4.4 Spring 3.0.2 Demo App","body":"### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nRecently I was working on a jBPM prototype. The integration with Spring wasn’t a smooth ride. In my previous projects, I used jBPM3.2. But it seems jBPM4 is pretty much a rewrite. There are couple of few nice additions like service API’ for task and process management, support for java task and many more. And there are few changes which I didn’t like. Till 4.2 the support for JPA was provided, which is taken off starting 4.3 release. Yes definitely you can write some wrappers and still achieve it. But!! Between 4.3 and 4.4 also there are some major API changes. So the whole point is to get the app running, I had to digg into mailing lists and source code. Now that it works, I thought I would write a short blog about it.:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd jbpm-spring-demo\r\n$ mvn jetty:run\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
